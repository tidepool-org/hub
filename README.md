Central storage for Tidepool planning and issue tracking.

This repository exists to provide a central place where we can put public items related to planning and execution of Tidepool projects. We do this because trying to manage a couple of dozen repositories individually will get a little bit too crazy.

We expect the issues in this repository to be pretty active, but they may be rather high level. If a high level task gets created in this repository, we can create a list of sub-issues in individual project repositories that need to be completed to close it.

If you identify an issue within any part of a Tidepool system and you don't know where to file it, please file it here, and we'll triage it into the right place.

The links to the public Trello boards that coincide with the issues in this repo are:
* [Platform Board](https://trello.com/b/xLF1XmeQ/platform) - This board details all of the current back-end tasks
* [Platform Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/48QNdfoh/platform-roadmap) - Roadmap for Tidepool platform development. Any tasks on the Wish List with a brown label are open for contribution.
* [Blip Board](https://trello.com/b/GPadCYvP/blip) - This board details all of the current blip-related tasks
* [Blip Product Backlog](https://trello.com/b/iKydvoiJ/blip-product-backlog) 
* [Open Source Tasks](https://trello.com/b/uTNKzwka/open-source-tasks) - Tasks across all projects that are open for contribution.

If you start work on a card from any of the Trello boards, please talk with us so we know you're working on it.
